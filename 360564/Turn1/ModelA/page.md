3. **GitHub Pages Settings:**
   - Go to your repository's settings on GitHub.
   - Under the "GitHub Pages" section, set the source to "master branch /docs folder" (or use the root folder for README.md).
   - Click "Save."

#### Read the Docs:
1. **Create an Account:** If you don't have one.
2. **Connect to GitHub:** From your Read the Docs account, connect your GitHub repository.
